# Claude Monitor

macOS floating always-on-top window that shows active Claude Code CLI sessions as pixel art Claude sparkles.

## Tech Stack
- **Swift / AppKit** — native macOS app, no frameworks
- Single file: `Sources/main.swift`
- Built with `swift build`, run with `.build/debug/ClaudeMonitor`

## How It Works
- Polls `ps -eo pid,tty,%cpu,command` every 2s on a background queue to find `claude` processes
- Only shows interactive sessions (real TTY, not `??`, not `-p` subagents)
- CPU smoothed over 3 samples with hysteresis (2+ ticks >5% CPU) to avoid false "working" triggers
- Three states: **idle** (waiting), **working** (active CPU), **done** (was working, now needs input — hand raised)

## Sprites
- Claude sparkle shape (4-pointed star like the CLI banner `▐▛███▜▌`), not a human
- Rendered as pixel art arrays using `CGContext` + `NSBitmapImageRep`, pre-cached at launch
- Colors: `C`=orange, `L`=light, `c`=dark, `O`=outline, `G/g`=screen, `K/k`=desk, `B`=keyboard

## Session Names
- Each session gets a persistent 3-letter name (e.g. `hex`, `nyx`, `vox`) hashed from TTY via djb2

## Ghostty Tab Switching
- Finds Ghostty's child `/usr/bin/login` processes sorted by PID = tab order
- Maps session TTY to tab index, simulates `Cmd+N` keypress via `CGEvent`
- Requires Accessibility permission for keystroke simulation

## Window
- `NSPanel` with `.floating` level, borderless, transparent background, draggable
- Rounded dark content view, auto-resizes as sessions appear/disappear
- Menu bar sparkle icon with Show/Quit
- `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` — no dock icon
